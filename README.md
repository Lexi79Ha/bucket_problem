<h4> A video illustrations of this riddle and the steps to finding a solution can be found here <br>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtg9pSJsRSg) </h4>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<h4>This program uses a while not loop under the conditions that "Five_gallon_bucket = 4 and the three_gallon_bucket = 0"</h4>
<h4>The steps of the loop are as followed: Fill five_gallon_bucket, Pour five_gallon_bucket into the three gallon bucket, then empty three gallon bucket once it reached max capacity, this continues until all conditions are satisified</h4>
